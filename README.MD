# query-searcher

## Description

query-searcher let you search and filter in your JavaScript's objects. It can be an array of mails, db results, or whatever you want.

## Installing

```sh
# with npm
npm install --save query-searcher

# with yarn
yarn add query-searcher

# with pnpm
pnpm add query-searcher
```

## Documentation

The searcher ignores accents and case, so "Something" and "s√¥Mething" return the same result

You can use logic doors like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

You can use parenthesis too, in order to manage priorities

You can use simple-quotes and double-quotes to search spaces or logics doors as a text. You can also escape spaces with anti-slashes.

## Examples

```ts
import Searcher from 'query-searcher'

const objectsToFilter = [
  {
    id: 1,
    from: 'Someone',
    to: ['Another'],
    subject: 'test1',
    date: new Date(2013, 1, 1),
    seen: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    from: 'Somebody',
    to: ['Some other'],
    subject: 'Something',
    date: new Date(),
    seen: false
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    from: 'Someone other',
    to: ['Somebody'],
    subject: 'Something and Nothing',
    date: new Date(2020, 12, 24),
    seen: false
  }
]

const searcher = new Searcher()
searcher.run('Something', mails) // second and third items
searcher.run('from:Someone', mails) // first and third items
searcher.run('to:(Someone OR Another)', mails) // first item

```
